# __Christy's Hangman Game Project__
**Version 1.0.0**

## __Hangman Game Play Instructions:__
#### 
To start playing the hangman game, please follow these instructions:

* Use the command line in your terminal and type node .     (node, space + .)  
* Type 1 letter into the command line to guess a letter. Please guess only 1 letter at a time. 
* It will not matter if you enter a letter as lowercase or uppercase, but you cannot enter characters.
*  You will have 6 incorrect guesses to stay in the game to guess the word.
*  For each incorrect guess, a 'man part' will appear, revealing the 'body' if you don't guess the word in 6 guesses.
*  If you guess the word in less than 6 guesses, you won the round.  If you don't, you lost.
*  You can exit/stop the game at anytime by typing ctrl c in the terminal.
## __Installation__
#### This game runs using the command line in Visual Studio Code.
## __Contributions__
#### This is a project for my portfolio. It is a 'work in progress' so I will be working on it over time to get it to 'work'. I've worked with my JS instructors (Matina & Jamal) to review my code. Otherwise, I should not take outside input on this project.
## __Authors and Acknowledgement__
#### Christy Hutchins is the author of this code. I did reference books on Javascript, game counters, YouTube videos, a google image search for making a drawing out of characters, and help from Jamal and Matina (JS Instructors) to trouble shoot my code. I have two index.js versions; the first is my first attempt, the second is a second attempt.

#### This is an open source project. Please feel free to comment.
## __Project Status__
#### This is a work in progress! My submitted code now works, but I need to work out why my answer array is showing -1: undefined. This is why I left the console.log showing the word to the player for now. I will keep working on it!
